# Prior Experiences
As an experienced web developer, I have successfully delivered various external projects, including an e-commerce platform and a real-time chat application. These projects have honed my skills in ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. I have also gained expertise in user authentication and data security using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), positioning me well to contribute to StudyNotion.

As an accomplished web developer, I bring a wealth of experience in delivering successful projects that have made a tangible impact. Some of my notable prior experiences include:

## E-commerce Platform - TechTrends
As a key member of the development team at TechTrends, I played a vital role in building a feature-rich e-commerce platform from the ground up. Utilizing ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS with ExpressJS for the backend, I implemented a seamless user interface, intuitive navigation, and robust product catalog management. Working closely with the design team, I ensured a visually engaging and responsive platform that provided an exceptional shopping experience for customers. Additionally, I integrated secure payment gateways and optimized the application for high performance, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and higher conversion rates.

## Real-time Chat Application - ChatterBox
At ChatterBox, a real-time chat application start-up, I led the development of a modern and efficient communication platform. Leveraging ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS with ExpressJS for the backend, I engineered a scalable and responsive messaging system capable of handling thousands of concurrent users. I integrated WebSockets for real-time updates, allowing users to exchange messages seamlessly. To ensure data security and privacy, I implemented end-to-end encryption for all messages and user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The successful launch of ChatterBox garnered positive user feedback and widespread adoption, establishing it as a leading communication tool in its niche.
